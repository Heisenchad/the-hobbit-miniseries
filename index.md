If you loved the wonder and grandeur of An Unexpected Journey, but couldn't stand the Fíli-Tauriel romance or some of Alfrid’s antics later in the series, this fanedit miniseries is your perfect escape.

The Hobbit (Miniseries) splits PJ’s trilogy into 11 episodes, each running ∼45 minutes and named after the book chapters. This edit preserves the original structure of the films, carefully trimming away the Fíli-Tauriel romance and Alfrid's antics to maintain a more focused narrative. Plot-wise, the one key alteration involves the death of Kíli, which now occurs simultaneously with Fíli's, witnessed by Thorin and Bilbo. With these changes, this miniseries is ideal for fans who want to immerse themselves as much as possible in the world of Middle-Earth without minor distractions.

Crafted from the original Blu-ray Extended Editions, this fanedit ensures the highest possible quality in both video and audio, and is available both in English and Spanish.
